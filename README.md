# dokScreeps
dokScreeps powers my screeps.com account dokman.

## Design Goals
* Low Memory Footprint - Keep CPU usage low, spend it on other more important things like maximum number of creeps.
* Automated Expansion - Let the bots make decisions, ideally opening screeps just to check on things and maybe give it a nudge in the right direction.
* Defense first, offense second - This will not be a total world domination bot, the idea here is to have a thriving colony.
*More to come soon*

## Contributions
Contributions are welcome, however this is not a serious project of mine and the needs/design goals of the bots may change over time as my play style changes. Feel free to fork the project and develop your own features and implement your own design goals.

## Support
No support is offered for the bot at the moment, use it at your own risk. This is a relaxation/enjoyment project of mine and wish it to remain that way. If you are stuck or need help, Google, YouTube, and ChatGPT are your friends.

## Version Information
* `v1` - My first introduction into Screeps which got me destroyed within the first 48 hours. Version has since been deleted and lost to time.
* `v2` - My first serious attempt at growing a presence on Screeps. Code base works, mainly relies on flags and uses heavy CPU.
* `v3` - Latest attempt at growing a Screeps presence with a focus on automatic human-free decision making. Complete rewrite from the ground up.
